        Child Abduction is the unauthorized removal of a minor (children
        specifically under 18 years old) from their legal parents or guardians'
        custody. The evil of child abduction is not uncommon; if anything, it is
        prevalent. The United States Department of Justice reports that as many
        as 200,000 children are kidnapped per year, and that is specific only to
        family abduction, which occur from within families.

      <p>
        Amber Alert is an emergency broadcast system used by the United States
        to alert local areas of a child abduction currently occurring. It is
        named after Amber Hagerman, a girl from Arlington, Texas who was
        abducted and found dead days later in 1996. Though Amber Alerts are
        broadcasted for every device, including television and phone, awareness
        of child abduction remains lackluster, contributing to the increased
        nature of AMBER Alerts especially within this year (2019) and region of
        this website (Pennsylvania).
